I am a **Backend Engineer** with a rich history in **Mobile Development**. My career began by crafting high-performance mobile experiences for Android and iOS, which gave me a "user-first" mindset that I now apply to building scalable, resilient server-side architectures.

Currently, I'm focused on the intersection of **Event-Driven Microservices** and **Autonomous AI Agents**.

### 🛠 My Technical Toolbox

#### **Backend & Infrastructure**
* **Languages:** Python (Primary), SQL, NoSql
* **Data & Messaging:** PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka.
* **DevOps:** Docker, Containerization.

#### **The AI Stack (Current Deep Dive)**
* **Orchestration:** LangChain & LangGraph (Stateful, multi-agent systems).
* **Connectivity:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) for integrating LLMs with local/remote data.
* **Observability:** LangSmith (Testing, tracing, and optimizing LLM calls).

#### **Mobile Heritage (Foundational Experience)**
* **Native:** Android (Kotlin/Java), iOS (Swift).
* **Cross-Platform:** Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), Flutter.

### 🧪 What I'm Experimenting With
Right now, I'm building **Agentic Workflows**. I'm particularly interested in how **LangGraph** can solve complex, non-linear business logic that traditional backend code struggles with, and using **MCP** to bridge the gap between LLMs and secure internal data.
